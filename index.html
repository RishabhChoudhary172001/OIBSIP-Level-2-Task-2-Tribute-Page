        <h1>Early life</h1>
        <p>
          Musk was born June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa, the
          son of Maye (n√©e Haldeman), a model from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada;
          and Errol Musk, a South African-born electromechanical engineer. He
          has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca
          (born 1974). His paternal grandmother was British, and he also has
          Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk
          lived mostly with his father in locations in South Africa. At age 10,
          he discovered computing with the Commodore VIC-20. He taught himself
          computer programming and at age 12 sold the code for a BASIC-based
          video game he created called Blastar to a magazine called PC and
          Office Technology for approximately US$500. A web version of the game
          is available online. Musk was severely bullied throughout his
          childhood, and was once hospitalized when a group of boys threw him
          down a flight of stairs and then beat him until he blacked out. Musk
          was initially educated at private schools, attending the
          English-speaking Waterkloof House Preparatory School. Musk later
          graduated from Pretoria Boys High School and moved to Canada in June
          1989, just before his 18th birthday, after obtaining Canadian
          citizenship through his Canadian-born mother.
